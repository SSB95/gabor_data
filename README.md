# Gabor Patches Dataset + Generator

This repo contains the scripts I have used to generate the data I have used for my semester thesis as well as a very small sample dataset. The purpose of the work was to investigate the behavior of an attention-constrained networks making decisions. The work in my thesis is based on the work of Mnih et al. [1], but is not (yet) published.
